	<h1>Reading the Wealth of Nations</h1>
		<h4>I plan to read in its entirety An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (generally referred to by the short title The Wealth of Nations) which was written in 1776 by Adam Smith. 
			Most of modern economic thought is based on this book, so as someone with a Bachelor's Degree in Economics, it should be very relevant to my education. 
			The purpose of these entries will be to re-exam what I have read to understand what is being put across in the book. Hopefully I'll also find current real world examples to demonstrate the points made in the book.

    <div id="div1"><h3>Book One - Chapter 1: The Division of Labour</h3>
					According to Smith there are three major advantages to the division of labour; first increased dexterity of each worker- it is easier to master and improve one small piece of work than to master and improve the entirety; second time saved from not needing to switch modes of work; and third the invention of machines to take over certain steps of the process allowing for fewer workers to produce more output.
					<br /><br />
					Smith explains these benefits of division of labour by more or less using an example of an assembly line being able to produce a far greater amount of products than any one individual would be able to produce. The he moves on to how the division of labour allows people to more easily see how it is that machinery could be used to simplify and speed manufacturing. It is also mentioned that this division of labour allows for outsiders to look into a process and see ways to simplify processes with greater ease.
					<br /><br />
					Later Smith goes on to say that the accommodations of the poor in a well established society with divided labour are far superior to that of even African Kings.
					<br /><br />
					My Conclusions:<br />
					In order for a society to properly progress from "savages" who hunt, grow, and scavenge for their food, to a society of abundance it is necessary that labour be divided. This division allows for progress far greater than imaginable. In a society of divided labour individuals have specialities and can be highly productive, which allows for all of the society to enjoy a better quality of life.
					<br /><br />
					Smith's discussion of the division of labour makes me think Ford got his idea for the assembly line from Adam Smith.
					<br /><br /><br /><br />
	</div>
    <div id="div2"><h3>Book One - Chapter 2: Of the Principle which gives occasion to the Division of Labour</h3>
					Here Smith remarks on the difference of humans and animals. He states that while humans benefit from the differences in each human by taking on specialities and making an abundance of a certain good to barter with, animals receive no such benefit from differences within a species. One animal does not barter with another and all animals are required to be self sustaining, which means that animals receive no benefit from have a speciality or division of labour.
					<br /><br />
					My Conclusions:<br />
					I'm not quite in agreeance with the idea that animals are incapable of working together and receive no benefit from working together, however this is not the main point so I'll move on. Smith was trying to demonstrate that it is only humans who benefit from the division of labour because we are capable of making more of a certain good than we need for ourselves and then trade the excess.
					<br /><br /><br /><br />
	</div>
	<div id="div3"><h3>Book One - Chapter 3: That the Division of Labour is Limited by the Extent of the Market</h3>
					Smith reasons that with a greater population each individual is able to become more and more specialized due to greater demand for his product. He goes on to say ease of trade has a similar effect to greater population, meaning that there will be greater people demanding the goods of each individual. This is demonstrated by looking at areas of the world where there are large populations or easy access to ports for trade. In these populous or port cities laborers are able to focus on a single area of their profession due to being able to trade for everything they need from the greater demand. However, in areas where there are not many individuals and there is no easy access to trade routes each person is required to expand the scope of their specialty in order to have enough good that are demanded, and to supply their own needs. In the book Smith uses the example of a nail maker, in a large city or trade town he can make only nails and be able to trade for everything else. However, in a small town he will need to make more than just nails because there is not the need for such great quantities to be able to sustain on the trade of nails alone.
					<br /><br />
					My Conclusions:<br />
					This chapter makes me realize just how important free trade is. Though there are reasons for protective tariffs and limits on trade, it seems that these strategies are not what is best in the long run. For real progress across the globe, trade needs to be easy and cost effective. We have seen great improvements to travel since the time of this book and much of the world has opened up, but there is still much room for improvement.
					<br /><br />
					Reading this section made me think about the North American Trade Agreement and how by dismantling numerous trade barriers, the agreement has contributed to an expansion in U.S. agricultural exports and increased the domestic availability of various farm and food products.
					<br /><br /><br /><br />
	</div>
	<div id="div4"><h3>Book One - Chapter 4: Of the Origin and Use of Money</h3>
					Smith starts out this chapter explaining why coins became the standard form of money. He explains it is because metal can be divided easily, or at least more easily, than other goods which allows for more precise payment. He uses the example of trying to buy salt with an ox, it is very unlikely that the man with the cattle needs a whole ox worth of salt, but since the ox cannot be divided without losing value the trade becomes complex. On the other hand, if the trade involved coins there would be no need to divide the ox, because the coins would be divided instead with little to no loss in value.
					<br /><br />
					My Conclusions:<br />
					Smith gives examples of the early currencies of many countries, making me wonder will the world eventually begin to use a standard currency? Europe has already began this transformation with the advent of the Euro, to make trade easier. With trade opening between more and more countries it does seem possible, however the initial transfer of currency to the new international currency may leave many underdeveloped countries with little to no capital.<br /><br /><br /><br />
					<br /><br /><br /><br />
	</div>
	<div id="div5"><h3>Book One - Chapter 5: Of the Real and Nominal Price of Commodities, or  their Price in Labour, and their Price in Money</h3>
					Smith explains that the real cost or value of anything is the amount of labour put into obtaining it. He states "Labour was the first price, the original purchase-money that was paid for all things." Smith does go on to say that because not all hours of labour are equal, people find it simpler when in a money based market to value objects by the amount of money paid, because the money is directly exchanged for it. However, an object of varying value can never be an accurate measure of the value of other things. Smith states "Labour alone, therefore, never varying in its own value, is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places be estimated and compared. It is their real price; money is their nominal price only." Because the value of money fluctuates it is only at the same place and time that the nominal value and the real value are the same. Smith writes in great detail of the differences in rates between gold, copper, and silver however as non of these are currently the standard exchanged for goods this section becomes lengthy and outdated.
					<br /><br />
					My Conclusions:<br />
					Basically what Smith is trying to convey is that the monetary cost of items is not as important as the amount of labor needed to secure those items.This is how he explain the difference between the real and nominal price of commodities.
					<br /><br />
					The second part of this chapter seemed as though every other word was shilling or pence or bullion or guinea comparing values of coins vs values of uncoined copper, silver and gold. Smith gets into the problems associated with being able to turn in bullion to the mint and receiving back the same weight of that metal in coinage.
					<br /><br /><br /><br />
	</div>
	<div id="div6"><h3>Book One - Chapter 6: Of the Component Parts of the Price of Commodities</h3>
					In this chapter Smith talks about what makes up the price of items and how that prices reflects the cost and labor that went into those items. He talks about the price of an item being split into the wages for the labor needed to produce the item, the rent of the land or cost of capital, and profit for the owner. Explaining that if it were not for the portion that is profit that the owner wouldn't bother to produce the item. Smith later goes into detail about the "profits of stock" explaining how the more money put into stock the greater the amount of profits, because profits are a percentage of stock that is sold. As a commodity is manufactured more times over the percent of profit and wages become larger than that of the rent. Also the percent that is profit becomes greater with each step of manufacturing. "But the whole price of any commodity must still finally resolve itself into some one or other, or all of those three parts; as whatever part of it remains after paying the rent of the land, and the price of the whole labour employed in raising, manufacturing, and bringing it to market, must necessarily be profit to somebody." By rent of the land he means all necessary capital to produce the commodity, which would include actual rent. He goes on to talk about how in businesses where the owner is also a laborer and produces the goods himself, that the distinction between the different costs tend to become blurred. That wages and profit are often not differentiated in these cases.
					<br /><br />
					My Conclusions:<br />
					To really summarize this chapter into its useful information, basically the further refined you make something the more profit you will gain. Nobody will put money into something that they do not think they will make a profit on. The larger the investment in capital the larger the potential profit. Skilled labor's make more then unskilled labors.
					<br /><br /><br /><br />
	</div>
	<div id="div7"><h3>Book One - Chapter 7: Of the Natural and Market Prices of Commodities</h3>
					The natural price of an item is determined by the quantity demanded vs the cost to make the item. When demand exceeds the quantity available the price goes up, such is the case with gasoline. And when the quantity demanded is less than what is available the price goes down, such as the case in clearance sales. Merchants use this information to manipulate markets to achieve normal profits. This is important because when an item is sold for too low the merchant will lose money and may go out of business, and when the item is sold for too much competitors will enter the market to help fill the demand thus lowering the price. This is how free markets always push toward equilibrium. Smith talks about effectual demand in this chapter, which is a term I have not heard before. He uses it to describe the quantity of an item demanded at a given price. When writing of the natural price "The whole quantity upon hand can be disposed of for this price, and cannot be disposed of for more. The competition of the different dealers obliges them all to accept of this price, but does not oblige them to accept of less." So the key is being able to sell all of ones inventory, while supplying all of the effectual demand and making a profit. As for the market price, that is simply defined as the price actually paid for a good.
					<br /><br />
					My Conclusions:<br />
					While in college I didn't quite understand the idea of normal profits. I understood how prices are determined and all of the influences but it just wasn't explained with the whole back story as it was in this chapter. In a market with few barriers to entry (difficulties in starting or closing a business) anytime an industry is making more than normal profits competitors will enter the market so that they too can make profit, and this will continue until the amount of profit is down to normal. Also when an industry is making less than normal profits, companies will leave and prices will rise until normal profits are once again achieved. All of this I understood back then but somehow I didn't make the link that most owners will not continue a business that only breaks even, they require profit to continue and this determines the normal profit, it is the least amount of profit required for a business to continue.
					<br /><br /><br /><br />
	</div>
	<div id="div8"><h3>Book One - Chapter 8: Of the Wages of Labour</h3>
					This is a huge and important chapter, Smith goes over many things that are still referenced today.
					<br /><br />
					"In all arts and manufacturers the greater part of the workmen stand in need of a master to advance them the materials of their work, and their wages and maintenance until it be completed."   In this sentence Smith describes the common laborer, who works for someone else and is paid a wage.  Describing the self-employed: "He is both master and workman, and enjoys the whole produce of his own labour, or the whole value it adds to the materials upon which it is bestowed.  It includes what are usually two distinct revenues, belonging to two distinct persons, the profits of stock, and the wages of labour."  It is also very clear that unions were then illegal.  When describing the difference in power of negotiation between worker and master over wages, the masters have a great advantage in combining, and the law is on his side.  The other factor in putting labours at the mercy of masters is that most labours live week to week, while masters usually are able to go far longer without revenue, and so they can hold out to get what they want much longer than labours.
					<br /><br />
					"When a landlord, annuitant, or monied man, has a greater revenue then what he judges sufficient to maintain his own family, he employs either the whole or part of the surplus in maintaining one or more menial servants." This is the type of statement that everyone knows the information but probably hasn't made the realization of its significance.
					<br /><br />
					Finally Smith goes on to say that "The increase of revenue and stock is the increase of national wealth.  The demand for those who live by wages, therefore, naturally increases with the increase of national wealth, and cannot possibly increase without it."  This means that it is only in growing nations that the wages of employees can grow.  he points out that at his current time wages in New York were higher than wages in London because New York while not as rich as England was growing whereas England was not. Because of this increasing wage from growth, people were having more children because children were a source of revenue instead of debt.
					<br /><br />
					Most disturbing quote so far "Marriage is encouraged in China, not by the profitableness of children, but by the liberty of destroying them.  In all great towns several are every night exposed in the street, or drowned life puppies in the water."  he mentions this as an example of a country who has great riches but because it has been long stagnant, as in not growing, the labor there are desperate for work because there are too many workers for the number of workers needed.
					<br /><br />
					"The scanty maintenance of the laboring poor, on the other hand, is the natural symptom that things are at a stand, and their starving condition that they are going fast backwards."
					<br /><br />
					Next smith goes into how many children of the poor typically dies (not uncommon for 18/20) vs how many of the wealthy can't even have children, stating that many wealthy women are barren.  That was interesting to consider but next he says that when a nation is growing the death rate of the children of the poor goes down because they are able to earn more and take better care of the children.  So together this means that he is suggesting that when more workers are needed more children live and when less workers are needed more children die...
					<br /><br />
					 Next Smith goes into why slavery is not best for making money, because they do not have nearly the same amount of motivation to work well as do freemen.
					<br /><br />
					My Conclusions:<br />
					Well this chapter seems to have in it just about everything I have ever heard being attributed to Adam Smith except the famous "No such thing as a free lunch".  
					<br /><br /><br /><br />
	</div>
	<div id="div9"><h3>Book One - Chapter 9: Of the Profits of Stock</h3>
					 "In countries which are fast advancing to riches, the low rate of profit may, in the price of many commodities, compensate the high wages of labour, and enable those countries to sell as cheap as their thriving neighbors, among whom the wages may be lower."  Next Smith talks about what happens if wage workers get a raise, saying that the price would only rise in arithmetical proportion to the raise in wages, however "if the profits of all the different employers of those working people should be raised five per cent, that part of the price of the commodity which resolved itself into profit would, through all the different stages of the manufacture, raise in geometrical proportion."
					<br /><br />
					He ends this chapter with "Our merchants and master-manufacturers complain much of the bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and therefore lessening the sale of their goods both at home and abroad.  They say nothing concerning the bad effects of high profits.  They are silent with regard to the pernicious effects of their own gains.  They complain only of those of other people. 
					<br /><br />
					My Conclusions:<br />
					I guess I hadn't fully realized how much Smith really was upset with the wealthy of England.  It becomes apparent in this chapter that he was largely motivated in writing this book to push his ideals maybe more than his ideas into the public conscious.
					<br /><br /><br /><br />
	</div>
	<div id="div10"><h3>Book One - Chapter 10: Of Wages and profit in the different Employments of labour and Stock</h3>
					This chapter has two parts
					<br /><br />
					Part 1: Inequities arising from the Nature of the Employments themselves.
					<br /><br />
					Five principle circumstances, which make up for a small pecuniary gain in some employments, and counterbalance a great one in others:
					<br /><br />
					1. The agreeableness or disagreeableness of the employments themselves<br />
					 - disagreeable work leads to higher wages to get people to do it, and pleasant work pays little because everyone wants to do it<br />
					<br />2. The easiness and cheapness, or the difficulty and expense of learning the employments.<br />
					- The more time or cost to learn a profession will mean earning more in it, so that the employed both makes back a liveable wage plus the cost of their investment.  <br />
					<br />3. The constancy or inconstancy of employment
					- professions with an off season (such as construction) will need higher wages to cover their expenses for both when they are employed and for when they are not.<br />
					<br />4. The small or great trust which must be reposed in those who exercise the employment<br />
					- positions of trust must be compensated so that those employed in them are able to be of a high rank in society as required by trust because "Such confidence could not safely be reposed in people of a very mean or low condition."<br />
					<br />5. The probability or improbability of success in the employment<br />
					- "The probability that any particular person shall ever be qualified for the employment to which he is educated is very different in different occupations."<br />
					<br /><br />
					"To excel in any profession, in which but few arrive at mediocrity, is the most decisive mark of what is called genius or superior talents.  The public admiration which attends upon such distinguished abilities makes always a part of their reward; a greater or smaller in proportion as it is higher or lower in degree."<br />
					<br /><br />
					Smith then decides to discuss the lottery saying "the more tickets you adventure upon, the more likely you are a loser.  Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose for certain; and the greater the number of your tickets the nearer you approach to this certainty."  He then discusses how when young people are deciding their profession, due to the time of their life, they are likely to contempt risk and have a presumptuous hope of success.   He then uses the example of how many young and especially common People enlist as soldiers and go to sea, which those who are "of better fashion" are more likely to go into liberal professions.<br />
					<br /><br />
					"Of the five circumstances, therefore, which vary the wages of labor, two only affect the profits of stock; the agreeableness or disagreeableness of the business, and the risk or security with which it is attended." <br />
					<br /><br />
					For these 5 forces to work properly 3 things are requisite:
					<br /><br />
					1. The employments must be well known and long established in the neighbourhood<br />
					- wages are higher in new trades than in old established ones<br />
					<br />2. The employments must be in their ordinary, or natural state<br />
					- "The demand for almost every different species of labor is sometimes greater and sometimes less than usual."<br />
					<br />3. The employments must be the sole or principle employments of those who occupy them.<br />
					- "When a person derives this subsistence from one employment, which does not occupy the greater part of his time, in the intervals of his leisure he is often willing to work as another for less wages then would otherwise suite the nature of the employment."<br />
					<br /><br />
					Part 2: Inequalities by the Policy of Europe
					<br /><br />
					The policy of Europe occasions inequities:
					<br /><br />
					1. By restraining the competition in some employments to a smaller number than would otherwise be disposed to enter into them.<br />
					- "By the 5th of Elizabeth, commonly called the Statue of Apprenticeship, it was enacted that no person should for the future exercise any trade, craft, or mystery at that time exercised in England, unless he had previously served it to an apprenticeship of seven years at least" <br />
					<br />2. By increasing it in some employments beyond what it would naturally be<br />
					- By setting minimum wage requirements for example to clergy, many more people go into the profession than can be employed by it, because there are already many other compensations such as respect that are not reflected by the wage<br />
					<br />3. By obstructing the free circulation of labor and stock, both from employment to employment and from place to place.<br />
					- By making it difficult for workers to move from one shire to the next, there were sometimes too many workers in one profession while not enough workers in another because the excess in one shire were not easily able to move to fill the deficit in another.<br />
					<br /><br />
					My Conclusions:<br />
					This chapter reiterates Smith's belief that when there is no interference in the market by outside forces the prices and wages will naturally reach the price necessary to properly compensate those involved.  He believes that given perfect liberty and fluidity of employment the holes in society will be more easily filled.
					<br /><br /><br /><br />
	</div>
	<div id="div11"><h3>Book One - Chapter 11: Of the Rent of Land</h3>
					 This chapter has 3 parts:
					<br /><br />
					"Rent, it is to be observed, therefore, enters into the composition of the price of commodities in a different way from wages and profit.  High or low wages and profit are the causes of high or low price; high or low rent is the effect of it.  It is because high or low wages and profit must be paid, in order to bring a particular commodity to market, that its price is high or low."  - Basically a landlord will charge all that a renter is able to pay but not more, and only unknowingly less.
					<br /><br />
					Part 1: Of the Produce of Land which always affords Rent
					<br /><br />
					"Land, in almost any situation, produces a greater quantity of food than what is sufficient to maintain all the labor necessary to bring it to market in the most liberal way in which that labor is maintained.  The surplus, too, is always more than sufficient to replace the stock which employed that labor, together with its profits.  Something, therefore, always remains for a rent to the landlord."
					<br /><br />
					Basically in this part he breaks down how the rent of the land is determined by what can be made from that land.  He also explains that if more could be made by land if used in another fashion such as growing corn instead of raising cattle that the land would be switched to that use, unless prohibited by law.
					<br /><br />
					"In all great countries the greater part of the cultivated lands are employed in producing either food for men or food for cattle.  The rent and profit of these regulated the rent and profit of all other cultivated land.  If any particular produce afforded less, the land would soon be turned into corn or pasture; and if any afforded more, some part of the lands in corn or pasture would soon be turned to that produce."
					<br /><br />
					Part 2: Of the Produce of Land which sometimes does, and sometimes does not, afford Rent
