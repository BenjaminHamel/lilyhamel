		<h3>My Wedding Bouquet</h3>
			<div class="creationsimgtext">
				<img src="images/creations/bouquets/lilypattybouquet.jpg" align="left" />
				<p>To the left is Patty, my Maid of Honour, and myself on the big day. 
				   I made a bouquet for each of us, using about a third more stems in mine.
				</p>
				<p>After researching the cost of real flowers, I decided to look into other options. 
				   I quickly stumbled upon crystal bouquets, and thought they were beautiful!
				</p>
				<p>I didn't want to part from the idea of flowers entirely, so I decided to also incorporate flower shaped beads along with the crystals and pearls.
				   It really surprised me that I couldn't find any instances on the internet of other people thinking to do this.
				</p>
				<p>I read <a href="http://offbeatbride.com/2010/02/crystal-bouquets" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> for the technique to make the stems.
				   I purchased almost all of the beads from ebay, and used 24 gauge solid copper wire.
				   Because the copper wire was bare, I asked my wonderful mother-in-law, Maryann to spray the stems with a protective clear coat to keep the copper shiny for years to come.
				   Maryann works with bare copper wire as an artist, you can check her out at <a href="http://www.curliosity.com" target="_blank">Curliosity</a>. 
				 </p>
				<p>However, when it came time to complete the bouquets, I wanted to do something nicer, and after some searching found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2iTqNxI1Og" target="_blank"> this YouTube video </a>. 
				   That is how I learned to use satin wrapped around and pinned in place to cover the stems, then I added the gold ribbon to fully secure the satin and complete the look.
				</p>
				<p>The bouquets were a huge hit!
				   <br />Everyone complemented us on how beautiful they were, and loved the idea as a souvenir!

				<p>Created 2011
				</p>
				<p>The cat is meant to be our cat Zoe, a tiny black cat, Ben got her a few months before we met.
				</p>
				<p>The cube with the heart is a Companion Cube from the game Portal which is one of Ben's favourites! 
				</p>
				<p>The computer with 2 monitors is meant to represent Ben's work space. 
				   The computer tower case is modelled after the case he custom painted with his mother, back when he was in High School.
				</p>
				<p>The lily is for me.
				</p>
				<p>The divided circle is meant to be a cheese pizza, our favorite food!
				</p>
				<p>The ring is supposed to look like my engagement ring.
				</p>
				<p>The frog is there because Ben loves frogs, and collects frog décor.
				</p>
				<p>The Android guy is for Ben's initial love of the Android operating system and it's potential.
