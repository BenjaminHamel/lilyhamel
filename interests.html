		<h2><a href="travel.html">Travel</a></h2>
			<p>Though I don't travel too often, I have been many places, and want to see more!
			</p>
			<p>These are my reviews of the places I have been.
			</p>
		<h2><a href="food.html">Cooking & Baking</a></h2>
			<p> I love to bake delicious goodies, and enjoy knowing how to make a variety of food.
			</p>
			<p>I have learned my tricks of the trade and would love to share that knowledge, along with the things I learn in the future!
			</p>
			<p>Making a new dish for the first time is an adventure that begs to be shared!
			</p>
		<h2><a href="greatreads.html">Great Reads</a></h2>
			<p>I read many books in various formats; audiobook, ebook, paperback, or hardback - it's all good to me! 
			</p>
			<p>*I don't believe in deterring people from books, so I will only promote the best of what I read, and leave out the rest*
			</p>
		<h2><a href="music.html">Music I Love</a></h2>
			<p>I tend to be highly lyrically orientated, and enjoy music that is calm with a nice flow.
			</p>
			<p>While in college I organized my vast music collection into play-lists based on subject matter and moods. 
			       Some of those lists I will share here.
