					<td>288</td>
					<td>5/5</td>
					<td>Outwitting the Devil, states powerfully that &#34;drifters of thought and thinking patterns cry that the world has run dry of opportunities, but non-drifters do not wait for opportunity - they create these.&#34; 
					    Within the pages of the book, an interview between the author and the Devil is taking place. 
						The Devil&#39;s great concern is that real thinkers may appear on earth... and they would share with others the &#34;greatest of all truths - that the time spent fearing something would, if reversed, give mankind all he wants in the material world and save him after death.&#34; 
						The problem exists as more than choice of thoughts. 
						One must be repetitive to the point of establishing an ongoing rhythm that flows without effort. 
						This rhythm is the &#34;last stage of habit.&#34; 
						Drifting and procrastination are the same practical knowledge. 
					    Hypnotic rhythm makes dominating thoughts AND thinking patterns permanent. </td>

						    Two pigs Napoleon (Stalin) and Snowball (Trotsky) lead the Revolution, supported by the animals of the farm and the hard work of the horse, Boxer. 
							The only one that seems unconvinced is Benjamin the donkey who notes that donkeys live a long time and that life will go on as it always had gone on - badly. 
							Moses the Raven (the Church), who always speaks of Sugarcandy Mountain, somewhere up in the clouds, a magical place, also leaves for awhile. 
							The animals fight back an attack of Jones (Russian Civil War) to retake the farm and all seems to be going nicely. Things go well, or so the pig intelligentsia says, until a schism between Napoleon and Snowball regarding the building of a windmill. 
							Everything falls apart. 
							Napoleon eliminates all traitors and whenever anything goes wrong, it is Snowball that did it. Pigs become oppressors using dogs (KGB, etc.) to keep order. 
							Sheep constantly note - two legs bad, four legs good; until pigs walk on two legs when it is four legs good, two legs better. 
							Truth and imagined truth are blended. All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.

							The HeLa cells would be crucial for confirming that the vaccine worked and soon companies were created to grow and ship them to researchers around the world.

							If they do in fact prove to be Godspoken they are educated and become part of the elite that rules the people of this planet. 
						    The Godspoken are supposed to hear the voices of the Gods, and whenever they do or think something unworthy, they must cleanse themselves.

							I don’t want to give anything away, but let’s just say that these traits that show a person to be godspoken are more than they seem, and the entire belief system of Path is about to be turned upside down.  
							Until the two worlds begin communicating, Xenocide jumps back and forth between the storyline on path and the story that continues from Speaker for the Dead.

							Then the little girl dies, basically of a broken heart because she can't stand slavery and she sees it as deplorable.  
							Her father is killed shortly after (maybe shortly before, I don't specifically remember) and his wife, who is completely without compassion, sends all of the slaves, including Tom, to auction.  
							She then goes and lives with relatives.  
							Tom is next bought by a terrible owner who wants Tom to be a foreman on his plantation, but Tom is very Christian and refuses to harm a slave who attempted to run away.  
						    Tom stays true to his beliefs and never hurts another living soul, and the new owner beats him to death because of it, trying to break him. </td>

						<td>Janie, a fair-skinned black woman caught in the time period between the end of slavery and the civil rights movement, is the first woman in her family who has the opportunity to be defined as something other than property. 
						    Janie is unable to define herself or seek out the independence for which she longs; however, this is not due to the racism or prejudices of white society (in fact, there isn't a prominent white character in the book). 
							Instead, Hurston takes a fascinating look at intra-racial racism. 
							Janie's obvious "whiteness" sets her apart from the black community. 
							At first, she's envied for her pretty hand-me-down dresses and hair ribbons that she obtains from the kind white family for which her grandmother works. 
							Coupled with her straight hair (which hangs down to her waist), her exquisite beauty, and her light skin, she defies color categorization and leaves the question of "What is black?" lacking a definite answer. 
							Later, she's an outcast because her second husband's "big voice" and quest for power in the all black community of Eatonville comes to be identified with the white masters of days gone by, and Janie comes to be seen in the role of the Southern plantation "mistress."  
							Janie's grandmother tells her that the black woman is the "mule of the world," the lowest of the low. 
							Janie finds this to be true in her first two marriages, as she is treated like property by Logan Killicks and is later objectified by Jody Starks. 
						    It isn't until she meets Tea Cake, a man half her age, that Janie begins to live life on her own terms and not by the definition her man has set forth for her.</td>

							 Some rather wild things happen, such as a house being moved by helicopter and the porch falls off and lands on a dog of one the characters. 
							 Rather unrealistic, but the writer adds a lot of humour from the situation. 
							 Not that having a dog die is funny, far from it, but the way the situation is handled is funny. 
							 Eugene has lived a rather wild & crazy life and A.J. is a stable guy with a wife, kids and a job, yet the two have been friends since they were young boys. 
							 Eugene gets cancer and A.J. manages his care giving. 
							 Eugene requests that when the time comes & the pain gets to be too much that A.J. will shoot him so he doesn't have to suffer. 
							 A.J. tells him that there's no way he will do it. 
						     But then toward the end he sees him in extreme pain and nothing left off him, but skin & bones, just a shadow of what he once was</td>

							Oceania, and both of the others, is a totalitarian society led by Big Brother, which censors everyone’s behaviour, even their thoughts.  
							Winston is disgusted with his oppressed life and secretly longs to join the fabled Brotherhood, a supposed group of underground rebels intent on overthrowing the government.

							One day, while walking home, Winston encounters O’Brian, an inner party member, who gives Winston his address.  
							Winston had exchanged glances with O’Brian before and had dreams about him giving him the impression that O’Brian was a member of the Brotherhood.  
							Since Julia hated the party as much as Winston did, they went to O’Brian’s house together where they were introduced into the Brotherhood.  
							O’Brian is actually a faithful member of the Inner-Party and this is actually a trap for Winston, a trap that O’Brian has been cleverly setting for seven years.  
							Winston and Julia are sent to the Ministry of Love which is a sort of rehabilitation center for criminals accused of thought-crime.  
							There, Winston was separated from Julia, and tortured until his beliefs coincided with those of the Party.  
						    Winston denounces everything he believed him, even his love for Julia, and was released back into the public where he wastes his days at the Chestnut Tree drinking gin.</td>

						<td>Dagny Taggart, the Operating Vice President of Taggart Transcontinental, a giant railroad company originally pioneered by her grandfather, attempts to keep the company alive during difficult economic times marked by collectivism and statism. 
						    While Dagny runs the company from behind the scenes, her brother, James Taggart, the railroad's President, is peripherally aware of the company's troubles, but will not make any difficult choices, preferring to avoid responsibility for any actions while watching his company go under. 
							He seems to make irrational decisions, such as preferring to buy steel from Orren Boyle's Associated Steel, rather than Hank Rearden's Rearden Steel, despite the former continually delaying delivery of vital rail. 
							In this as in other decisions, Dagny simply goes ahead with her own policy and challenges him to repeal it. 
							As this unfolds, Dagny is disappointed to discover Francisco d'Anconia, a true genius and her only childhood friend, first love, and king of the copper industry, appears to have become a worthless playboy who is destroying his family's international copper company, which has made him into one of the richest and most powerful men in the world.  
							Hank Rearden, a self-made steel magnate of great integrity, has recently developed a metal alloy called Rearden Metal, now the strongest and most reliable metal in the world. Hank chooses to keep the instructions to its creation a secret, sparking jealousy and uproar among competitors. 
							False claims are made about the danger of the alloy and are backed by government agencies. As a result of this, pressure is put on Dagny to use conventional steel, but she refuses. 
							Hank's career is hindered by his feelings of obligation toward his manipulative wife, mother, and ungrateful younger brother, who show no appreciation for everything he provides for them. 
							Dagny also becomes acquainted with Wesley Mouch, a Washington lobbyist initially working for Rearden, whom he betrays. Mouch eventually leads the government's efforts in controlling all commerce and enterprise, intentionally destroying the common man's opportunity to build a largely successful, free-market business. 
							The reader also becomes acquainted with Ellis Wyatt, the sole founder and supervisor of the successful enterprise Wyatt Oil. 
							He is a young, self-possessed, hard-working man — one of the few men still loyal to Dagny and Hank's efforts in pushing for a system of business free of government meddling and control.  
							While economic conditions worsen and government agencies continue to enforce their control on successful businesses, the naïve, yet weary mass of citizens are often heard reciting the new, popular street phrase, "Who is John Galt?" 
							This sarcastic phrase is given in response to what tend to be sincere questions about heavy subjects, wherein the individual can find no answer. 
							It sarcastically means, "Don't ask important questions, because we don't have answers", or more broadly, "What's the point?" or "Why bother?"  
							In the final section of the novel, Taggart discovers the truth about John Galt, who is leading an organized "strike" against those who use the force of law and moral guilt to confiscate the accomplishments of society's productive members. 
							With the collapse of the nation and its rapacious government all but certain, Galt emerges to reconstruct a society that will celebrate individual achievement and enlightened self-interest, delivering a long speech (70 pages in the first edition) serving to explain the novel's theme and Rand's philosophy of Objectivism, in the book's longest single chapter</td>

						<td>Ron Chernow</td>
						<td>904</td>
						<td>3.5/5</td>
						<td>This book goes well beyond the myth of Washington and delves deeply into what made him the greatest American of his age. 
						    A man of phenomenal stature (militarily and politically), who was one of the first superstars of his era, he was also a man who was deeply flawed (owning hundreds of slaves and consistently in debt). 
						    Yet, he was also a man who was deeply principled. He committed most of his adult life to service to his country, often at the expense (literally) of his personal wealth and the management of his 30,000+ acres of his farms. 
							And even though he was a major slave-owner he did agonize about slavery, which he didn't like, but (in my opinion) didn't have the personal courage to deal with effectively in his lifetime, though he did free the slaves he owned upon his death. 
							After reading this book, one gets a new sense of who Washington was, a sense that goes well beyond the legend, and provides a realistic picture of this very important American.</td>

						<td>Empress Nur Jahan was the twentieth and favorite wife of Mogul Emperor Jahangir. 
						    Born into an aristocratic Persian family who had immigrated to India, her birth name was Mehrunnisa. 
							She was a remarkable beauty, with blue eyes and pale skin, who fell in love with Jahangir as a young girl serving Empress Ruqayya Sultan Begam (chief wife of Jahangir’s father, Emperor Akbar) in the Imperial harem. 
							Then a prince, Jahangir was likewise enamoured with her, but at seventeen she was married off to a soldier named Ali Quli as a sign of favor from the Emperor. 
							Numerous rebellions against Jahangir eventually led to Ali Quli’s death, however, and as a widow the now twenty-something Mehrunnisa was returned to Empress Ruqayya Sultan Begam’s side. 
							Inside the imperial harem again, Mehrunnisa’s love for Jahangir was finally allowed to bloom, and after some clever scheming on Ruqayya’s part Jahangir and Mehrunnisa married. 
							Upon ascension to the throne Jahangir renamed her Nur Jahan, which means “Light of the World.” 
							She had formidable skills in administration, politics, economics, and culture, all of which she could now use as Jahangir’s favorite wife. 
							Her power and influence were unprecedented in the Moghul empire, where women remained veiled behind the harem walls. 
							Nevertheless Nur Jahan was able to reach beyond the harem through determination, intelligence, and her passionate relationship with Emeperor Jahangir. 
							“The Twentieth Wife” begins with the birth of Mehrunnisa on a dusty side road as her family flees Persia, and ends with her ascension to the throne as Nur Jahan. 
							In between these two events is a remarkable story about love, destiny and the resilience of the human spirit. 
						    Sundaresan’s attention to historical detail and largely accurate representation of Nur Jahan’s life creates a vivid narrative that is hard to put down. </td>

							His family runs the local zoo, and he spends many of his days among goats, hippos, swans, and bears, developing his own theories about the nature of animals and how human nature conforms to it. 
							Pi’s family life is quite happy, even though his brother picks on him and his parents aren’t quite sure how to accept his decision to simultaneously embrace and practise three religions -- Christianity, Hinduism, and Islam.  
							But despite the lush and nurturing variety of Pi’s world, there are broad political changes afoot in India, and when Pi is sixteen his parents decide that the family needs to escape to a better life. 
							Choosing to move to Canada, they close the zoo, pack their belongings, and board a Japanese cargo ship called the Tsimtsum. 
							Travelling with them are many of their animals, bound for zoos in North America. 
							However, they have only just begun their journey when the ship sinks, taking the dreams of the Patel family down with it.

						<td>Dean Richards</td>
						<td>194</td>
						<td>5/5</td>
						<td>Psychology in Plain English is an easy-to-read, somewhat folksy book describing principles of psychology and how they relate to real life. 
						    Dr. Richards uses anecdotes, personal examples, wicked humour, and explanations honed through more than 30 years and more than 700 psychology classes to covers some of his most popular classroom topics. 
							How do we learn fears and phobias, and how can they be removed? 
							Why is punishment not the best learning technique, or even second best? How does psychology differ from common sense? 
							Is it true we only use 10% of our brains? 
							Why do averages often tell us very little? 
							Why does the English language, the language of science, business, and air traffic control, suck big time? 
							Topics run the gamut from the origins of sexuality, practical uses and limitations of punishments and rewards, the origins of fears and phobias, factors that make things funny, keys to human happiness, common human errors in decision making, functions of different parts of the brain, and even what makes psychology psychology to start with. 
						    The overall result is a scientifically-supported yet easily understandable description of some of the more cutting edge research in psychology.</td>

						    Where, as she soon learns, things are not all that she had thought they'd be. 
							There is violence, and slavery, and pain, and abandonment, and cruelty, and bureaucracy. 
							<br>Along the way, September meets a Wyverary, a wish-granting Marid, the evil Marquess, spoon-less witches, queen-less soap golem, migrating velocipedes, and a jacket that is eager to please, among others. 
							Along the way, she loses her heart, her shadow, her friends, and a great deal of her innocence. 
							And finds much more than she lost - or bargained for.</td>

						     From Meyer Lansky, the Lower East Side kid who grew to be the brains behind the Mob muscle and brawn, and the brilliant architect of who was very close to making Havana the "Monte Carlo of the Caribbean"; 
							 President Fulgencio Batista, the dictator of Cuba who gave the go ahead to the Mob casinos on Havana - as long as he received large shares of the profits; 
							 and cast of characters who are steep in Mob lore: Lucky Luciano, Santo Trafficante, Bugsy Siegel, even the Chairman of the Board himself, Frank Sinatra, makes a guest appearance. </td>

						<td>This is a remarkable work, decades in the making. Perkins is an economist who worked for international consortia to pillage the third world. 
						    The modus operandi was to perform economic analysis of target nations that indicated a rate of growth far in excess of any real possibility in order to justify offering those nations huge loans, loans they were never expected to be able to repay. 
							The point of this was twofold. 
							First, the money loaned would find its way right back into the pocket of American corporations, because it would be used for major construction projects, roads, dams, electrification projects. 
							The economic benefits would never accrue as predicted, so the host country would be saddled with crushing debt and then be forced by entities like the IMF to slash and burn domestic social services in order to make interest payments. 
							The benefits of the “development” would go to the elite of the host nations, at the expense of the lower classes. 
							In fact, he offers data showing that poverty increased over the term of such foreign investment. 
						    Local elites were essentially bribed to go along, and they in turn acted as enforcers for the American elite that was pushing the product.</td>

						<td>Gonzales approaches human error from several perspectives: psychology, sociology, cognitive science, evolution, and philosophy. 
						    I expected the book to deal with the psychology of error and fallibility but the scope is much more broad. 
							Gonzales approaches human error holistically and moves from individual and group error resulting from biases and blindness to foibles to the roots of error on a cosmological scale. 
							I found the early chapters thoroughly engaging as Gonzales blended case studies from a variety of contexts with personal anecdotes and crisp explanation of behavioural, cognitive and social mechanisms that lead to automatic unthoughtful behaviour and thereby to tragedy. As the author moved to more generalized and abstract principles, his exposition seemed more circuitous or convoluted causing me to fear he'd lost focus and wondered into a sort of new age hymn or rhapsody. 
						    I wondered whether he had a coherent thought train and was feeling that I hadn't the time for the paean when Gonzales abruptly startled and delighted me by noting that any reader who'd followed that far must be wondering whether the discussion then was relevant or connected to the opening chapters, and artfully pulled disparate threads back together to summarize his argument. </td>

						    Most of the contents included in this book are either still valid nowadays, or are historically interesting. 
						    Overall, I must say, it is quite "modern" in the sense of breaking secular myths about China, and bringing a more real, down-to-earth, view of this big country.</td>

						<td>Franny Banks is a struggling actress in New York City, with just six months left of the three year deadline she gave herself to succeed. But so far, all she has to show for her efforts is a single line in an ad for ugly Christmas sweaters and a degrading waitress job. 
						    She lives in Brooklyn with two room-mates - 
							Jane, her best friend from college, and 
							Dan, a sci-fi writer, who is very definitely not boyfriend material-and is struggling with her feelings for a suspiciously charming guy in her acting class, all while trying to find a hair-product cocktail that actually works. </td>

						<td>A powerfully moving & penetrating examination of how we live, a breathtaking meditation on how to live better. 
						    Here is the book that transformed a generation, an unforgettable narration of a summer motorcycle trip across America's Northwest, undertaken by a father & his young son. 
							A story of love & fear--of growth, discovery & acceptance--that becomes a profound personal & philosophical odyssey into life's fundamental questions, this uniquely exhilarating modern classic is both touching & transcendent, resonant with the myriad confusions of existence & the small, essential triumphs that propel us forward</td>
