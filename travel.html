			<h3>Petrified Forest, Arizona</h3>
				October 22, 2013 - with East Valley Brainiacs
				<div class="travelimgtext">

						   Group shot of all of us in the Petrified Forest!<br /><br />
						   This trip was planned by Geoff, an assistant organizer of the East Valley Brainiacs(second to last on the right). 
						   <br /><br />
						   We started the journey early in the morning to make the 3 hour drive from the Phoeniz area up to Holbrook to see the Petrified Forest.
						   The trip was a great deal of fun, and really something to experience.
						   The petrified fossils were beautiful and the blue badlands were great to explore!

						<p><br /><br />
							We started the trip near the Rainbow Forest Museum and ended by the Painted Desert Visitors Center.
						   <br /><br />
						   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrified_Forest_National_Park" target="_blank">From Wikipedia:</a>
						   "Petrified Forest National Park is a United States national park in Navajo and Apache counties in northeastern Arizona. 
						   Named for its large deposits of petrified wood, the park covers about 146 square miles (380 km2), encompassing semi-desert shrub steppe as well as highly eroded and colorful badlands."

							<a href="http://www.petrified.forest.national-park.com/info.htm#tree" target="_blank">From Petrified Forest National Park Information Page:</a>
						   <br />"This high dry tableland was once a vast floodplain crossed by many streams.
						   The tall trees, Araucarioxylon, Woodworthia and Schilderia, fell and were washed by swollen streams into the floodplain. 
						   There they were covered by silt, mud, and volcanic ash, and this blanket of deposits cut off oxygen and slowed the logsâ€™ decay. 
						   Most of the trees decomposed and disappeared. 
						   But a few trees were petrified, becoming the beautiful fossilized logs we see today. 
						   Gradually silica-bearing ground waters seeped through the logs, bit by bit, encased the original wood tissues with silica deposits. 
						   Slowly the process continued, the silica crystallized into the mineral quartz, and the logs were preserved as petrified wood.
						   Most of the fossilized logs are from Araucarioxylon arizonicum. 
						   Woodworthia and Schilderia, occur in small quantities in the northern part of the park. 
						   All 3 species are now extinct."

						<p><br /><br />
						   Some of the fossils are huge!<br /><br />
						   Here I am standing next to a large example.
						   <br />It still looks like a tree log, but it is now completely stone!

						<p><br /><br />
						   What is Petrified Wood?<br />
						   <br />Petrified wood, also referred to as silicified wood, is a common illustration of a quartz pseudomorph - wood is slowly replaced, cell by cell, by silica, until not a trace of the original material remains.
						   <br />Process: The structural arrangement of silicon and oxygen creates an open bonding structure that permits other ions such as various forms of iron to occupy interstitial positions in the molecule and bond to it, thus producing variations in color.
						</p>
						<p>How the very fine detail of the cell structure is preserved is not well understood. 
						   It would appear that less than cell sized gradients in acidity created very small reprecipitation gradients, replacing the wood on almost an atom by atom basis.
						</p>

						   <br /><br />Beautifully Colorful!<br /><br />
						   <a href="http://www.scienceviews.com/parks/woodcolors.html" target="_blank">From ScienceViews.com:</a>						   
						   <p>"Red and Pink colors are produced by the presence of hematite, a form of oxidized iron - Fe2O3. 
						          The intensity of the color depends on the quantity of hematite present in the petrified wood.</p>
						   <p>Yellow, Brown and Orange colors are produced by the presence of goethite - HFeO2 and Fe2O3. 
						         Goethite is a hydrated iron oxide that is derived by weathering from iron bearing minerals. 
								 It crystallizes into tablets, scales, needles, radial and concentric aggregates.</p>
						   <p>Green colored petrified wood is produced by pure reduced iron that is a magnetic, malleable mineral. 
						         The chemical composition is Fe. 
							     Referred to as native iron, it is quite rare in terrestrial rocks but common in meteorites. 
							     Native iron combines with chlorophyll to give tree leaves and plants their green colors but rarely attaches to wood cells.</p>
						   <img src="images/Travel/petrified forest/600_297270052.jpeg" width="500" align="left" >
						   <p>White is produced by pure silica - SiO2. Since silicon, Si, and oxygen, O, are the two most abundant elements in the earth&#39;s crust. 
						         Silica group minerals are common worldwide. Free silica, SiO2, referred to scientifically as silicon dioxide, occurs most commonly as quartz. 
								 Quartz is the principal element of glass. In many respects quartz is the most interesting of all minerals. 
								 It has a larger number of distinct varieties with wider differences than any other mineral.</p>						   
						   <p>Organic carbon or pyrite - FeS2 (iron sulfide), the most abundant and widespread sulfide mineral, produces Black. 
						         Because it was mistaken for gold it is often called "fool&#39;s gold.
								 Pyrite, translated freely, means "fire mineral", a reference to the sparks given off when struck.</p>
						   <p>Purple and Blue are produced by manganese dioxide - MnO2. 
						         This is a secondary material formed when water leaches manganese from igneous rock and re-deposits it as a concentration of manganese dioxide. 
								 As a result, it occurs more often as coatings on other minerals than as large crystals. 
								 Manganese is very important in the manufacture of steel.</p>
						   <p>Tan indicates silica dioxide is the predominate replacement mineral. 
						         This color is most often seen in permineralized wood. 
								 In permineralization, the wood&#39;s cell structure is better preserved, giving it the appearance of real wood. 
								 It should be noted that not all petrified wood in the park is permineralized. 
								 Permineralization also transpires when wood is preserved with calcite rather than silica. 
								 No calcified wood occurs in the park."</p>

						<p>"The colorful badland hills, flat-topped mesas, and sculptured buttes of the Painted Desert are primarily made up of the Chinle Formation, mainly fluvial (river related) deposits. 
						    Within Petrified Forest National Park, the layers of the Chinle Formation include the Blue Mesa Member, the Sonsela Member, the Petrified Forest Member, and the Owl Rock Member.

			<h3>Ringling Museum</h3>
				April 25, 2014 - with my mother and brother in the shade of the majestic Banyan trees

						   Located in Sarasota, FL the entrance fee of $25 adult admission grants you access to 3 museums, The Ringling Bayfront Gardens, and Mableâ€™s Rose Garden, all on the same property.
						</p>
						<p>
						   The Museum of Art is the official art museum of Florida and houses the Ringling&#39;s personal collection of art, the majority of which is European religious paintings.
						   This museum also features some borrowed works of art and has an area for travelling displays of various kinds. 
						   When we visited, the temporary display was an interesting set of sculptures, and that was my favorite display.
						</p>
						<p>The Circus Museum was created after John Ringling died, as it was considered in poor taste to point out the source of your wealth.
							This museum houses a miniature circus that takes up most of the museums space.  
						</p>
						<p>Ca&#39; d&#39; Zan was the winter home for John and Mable Ringling.
						   This mansion is has large amounts of marble and a beautiful marble patio with boat dock. 
						   Really something to see!

						   Mote Marine Laboratory is an independent not-for-profit marine research organization based on City Island in Sarasota, Florida. 
						   Founded in 1955 by Eugenie Clark in Placida, Florida, it was known as the Cape Haze Marine Laboratory until 1967. 
						   The laboratory aims to advance the science of the sea, both through its marine and estuarine research labs and through the public Mote Aquarium and its affiliated educational programs.
