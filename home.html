		 <p>Love to make people smile, it just in my style, to try to be funny, to create something sunny, 
		    a safe place, just in case, bit of compassion is all it takes, to change a face of despair,

			<h2>Who Am I</h2>
				<p>My name is Lily and I enjoy a wide range of interests. 
				   My favourite way to spend my free time is learning something new! 
				   This love of learning prompted my to join several book clubs, then later to start a Meetup.com group that focuses on learning and exercising our brains.
				</p>
				<p>I have a Bachelors Degree in Economics, but began by majoring in accounting. 
				   When I took my first Economics class in my first semester of college, I fell in love with the subject! 
				   I waited to switch majors because it wasn't clear what kind of job an economist would do. 
				   Later as my understanding of the field expanded, I realized that economics was actually a better choice for myself.
				</p>
				<p>Currently I work at a Cloud Solutions Provider as an Account Manager, working with clients to obtain and manage content for their applications or websites. 
				   I also manage all of our bookkeeping, including all accounts receivable and payable.
				</p>
			<h2>Why This Site</h2>
				<p>To demonstrate skills, share accomplishments, and look back at how my time was spent.
